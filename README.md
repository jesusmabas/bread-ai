# Bread AI - Your Intelligent Baking Assistant

Welcome to Bread AI, a sophisticated web application designed to take the guesswork out of bread and pizza making. Whether you're a novice baker or a seasoned professional, Bread AI provides the tools to create perfect dough every time. It combines a powerful deterministic fermentation formula with a cutting-edge AI baker powered by the Google Gemini API to give you unparalleled control over your baking process.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🤖 Natural Language Planner (AI Baker):** Simply describe what you want to bake in plain English or Spanish (e.g., "I want to make 4 Neapolitan pizzas for dinner on Saturday at 7 PM") and our AI will generate a complete, timed recipe and baking schedule for you.
*   **🧮 Formula-Based Planner:** For the purists, this mode generates a reliable baking plan based on a scientific fermentation formula. Input your parameters and get precise timings.
*   **👨‍🏫 Guided Setup:** Not sure where to start? Use our guided selectors to choose your desired **crumb** (tight, medium, airy), **crust** (soft, crispy, rustic), and **leavening pace** (fast yeast, balanced, or slow sourdough).
*   **🍞 Quick-Start Presets:** Jump right into baking with professionally-crafted presets for a variety of styles, including Country Loaf, Baguette, Ciabatta, Neapolitan Pizza, Roman Pizza, and more.
*   **🔬 Advanced Techniques:** Easily incorporate complex methods like **preferments (Poolish & Biga)** and long **cold fermentation** to enhance flavor and texture.
*   **📊 Real-Time Dough Insights:** As you adjust parameters, get instant feedback on your dough's properties, including final salinity, apparent hydration (how the dough will *feel*), elasticity vs. extensibility, and important warnings for challenging recipes.
*   **💧 DDT Calculator:** The integrated Desired Dough Temperature (DDT) calculator helps you determine the precise water temperature needed to start your fermentation perfectly.
*   **🆘 Dough Rescue Mode:** Is your dough not rising? Is it too sticky? Describe your problem and our AI will provide actionable steps to rescue your dough.
*   **📚 Recipe Management:** Save your favorite recipes to your personal library. Load, clone, share, export, and import recipes with ease.
*   **🌍 Multi-Language & Unit Support:** The app is fully available in **English** and **Spanish**, and supports both **Metric (g/°C)** and **Imperial (oz/°F)** units.
